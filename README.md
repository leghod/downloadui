# downloadui
A GUI tool for converting download speeds and estimating download times written in C++/CLI using winforms./n
I coded this in 24 hours, using my small amount of prior C++ knowledge and experience in C# and winforms to create this tool.
I created this to practice both my math skills and C++ skills as I have learnt most of my C++ knowledge within the last week and wanted to apply what I have learnt.
